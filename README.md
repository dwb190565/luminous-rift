## 📜 Lore

You are a **Conduit Pilot**, humanity’s last firewall inside the **Luminous Rift**—a bleeding tear between realities.  
Corrupted data shards and rogue algorithms manifest as hostile entities. Destroy them to keep the rift stable.

- **Enemies** = Glitched data fragments.  
- **Power-ups** = Stable code remnants from failed expeditions.  
- **Dream Mode** = A hyper-sync state that lets you “read” the rift’s raw data stream—at a cost.  
- **Core Anomalies** = Singularities of entropy; each defeat pushes the rift closer to closure.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas 2D Context  
- **Logic**: Vanilla ES6+ JavaScript (no frameworks)  
- **Audio**: Web Audio API + custom oscillator graphs  
- **Styling**: Minimal CSS for UI overlays
